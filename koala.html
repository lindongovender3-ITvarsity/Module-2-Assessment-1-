                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
                    It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae</p>

                <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. 
                   Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
                   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E26, right opposite the giraffes.</p>
